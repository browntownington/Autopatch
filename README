This is an auto-patch app for an android phone.

The initial goal is to be able to interface to a radio (via audio
cable) with an HT (e.g. Yaesu VX series) this is similar to a repeater
with auto-patch capability.  The motivation is simple, I fly a Hobie 16 
(type of sail boat) rather aggressively (read, "badly"), which
means I put it over on it's side and occasionally turtle it--I have 
drown three smart phones this way.  I have waterproof HTs (Yaesu VX7
and 8) and waterproof marine radios are readily available.  For various
reasons I typically have one of those HTs clipped to my life vest.  I
want to be able to make phone calls from my waterproof radio via my
mobile phone which I will leave at the boat house, if there's a person
doing this they are known as a marine operator (used to be more common)
if it's a machine it's called an auto-patch.


status: this is in progress. I have DTMF detection working now I need
to work out the interface with the phone. I'm thinking something like
'*' up, phone number, and '#' down, then I'll put some TTS (Text To
Speech) prompts in. Many marine radios have DTMF generators, DTMF is
simple and familiar to most ham operators and many mariners. I was
considering "Okay Google" but that was too easy. The UI on this is 
very basic, for now you enable it and set it next to your radio and
put the radio on VOX, boring!
