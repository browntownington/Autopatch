This is an autopatch app for an android phone.

The initial goal is to be able to interface to a radio (via audio
cable) with an HT (e.g. Yaesu VX series) this is simlar to a repeater
with autopatch capibility.  The motivation is simple, I fly a Hobie 16 
(type of sailboat) rather agressively (or badly if you like), which
means I put it over on it's side and ocasionally turtle it--I have 
drown three smart phones this way.  I have waterproof HTs (Yasu VX7
and 8) and waterproof marine radios are readily available (do they
have DTMF generators?).  For various reasons I typically have one of
those HTs clipped to my life vest.  I want to be able to make phone
calls from my waterproof radio via my mobile phone which I will leave
at the boat house, if there's a person doing this they are known as a
marine opperator (used to be more common) if it's a machine it's called
an auto-patch.


status: not even close yet.
I am still trying to work out the FFT to interpret the DTMF.  Most HTs
have DTMF generators and maybe down the road I'll play with speech
recognition.  Typically it goes something like * up and #down; that is,
one keys up one's radio, hits the * key, followed by the phone number,
you talk to your caller in half duplex and when you're done you hit #.
There are some annoying regulatory issues (e.g. remote secondary control)
to sort out but they are a low priority for now.
