This is an auto-patch app for an android phone.

The initial goal is to be able to interface to a radio (via audio
cable) with an HT (e.g. Yaesu VX series) this is similar to a repeater
with auto-patch capability.  The motivation is simple, I fly a Hobie 16 
(type of sail boat) rather aggressively (or badly if you like), which
means I put it over on it's side and occasionally turtle it--I have 
drown three smart phones this way.  I have waterproof HTs (Yaesu VX7
and 8) and waterproof marine radios are readily available.  For various
reasons I typically have one of those HTs clipped to my life vest.  I
want to be able to make phone calls from my waterproof radio via my
mobile phone which I will leave at the boat house, if there's a person
doing this they are known as a marine operator (used to be more common)
if it's a machine it's called an auto-patch.


status: this is still just a research project
Turns out marine radios don't have DTMF generators (though HTs do).
I'm looking at using Google's Speech Input API for Android.
